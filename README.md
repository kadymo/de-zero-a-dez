Web application inspired by the [site Tier Maker](https://tiermaker.com) and the [De Zero a Dez show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-e7oyEds7288nZ59AOXzPUbvIRbT5rAj) from TNT Sports Brasil.

I'm a fan of the Tier Maker website and TNT Sports' De Zero a Dez program, where they rank various football-related topics. So I decided to develop this site with the goal of creating an experience very similar to Tier Maker (drag and drop items into categories) but in the program's format, with scores and horizontal columns.

The site allows users to <b>create custom templates</b> that can be public or private when logged into an account. Public templates are added to the "community templates" section on the homepage.
